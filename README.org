#+TITLE: (Re)learning Backbone.js in 2016

This is just my adaptation of Addy Osmani's [[https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals][backbone-fundamentals]]
exercises while trying to fit it in a 2016/2017 JavaScript stack,
starting with [[https://nodejs.org][Node]] and [[https://github.com/webpack/webpack][webpack]], and also under a [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] environment.

* Getting started

Just needs Docker Compose to run out of the box:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker-compose up
#+END_SRC

And open http://localhost:8080.
